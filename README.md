# Managed Doom

![Managed Doom](screenshots/window.png)

The goal of this project is to make a fully functional Doom source port written in C# without unsafe code.  

The rendering engine is almost complete and capable of showing 3D view like the screenshots below.  

Now I'm working on the gaming code. Although several functionalities are still missing, most weapons, monsters and gimmicks work much like the original game.
